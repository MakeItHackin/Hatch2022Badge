# Hatch2022Badge

Thank you for being interested in this year's Hudson Alpha Tech Challenge Badge!!!  

View my YouTube video for a quick demo and overview:

The badges were designed by @MakeItHackin and sponsored by Hudson Alpha.  

The badge is in the shape of the Hudson Alpha logo.  It features a fully functioning circuit if you would like to solder components onto the top surface.  Using a 555 timer and a 4017 Decade Counter, the 10 LEDs will flash one by one.  Using the "speed" switch, the user can either pick a slow or fast blinking mode for the LEDs.  

If you have any questions or comments, please initiate an 'Issue' on github and I will answer as soon as I can.

Below are the components that can be soldered onto the badge for functionality:
CR2032 Battery and Holder
555 Timer
4017 Decade Counter
100 ohm 0805 resistors 
0805 LEDs
Two switches
Two capacitors (4.7uF and 22uF for changing speed)
Two 22kohm resistors for 555 timer
